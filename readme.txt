Automatically localize and affiliate Amazon product links to improve user experience, increase conversions and earn global commissions.


== Description ==

The Amazon Link Engine plugin is the easiest way to convert all Amazon links within your
WordPress site into affiliated links that work across all [Amazon storefronts](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/t22/a13).  By "Localizing"
these links, you ensure all clicks from international viewers are redirected to the appropriate
item in their own local storefront with your correct affiliate ID attached.  This improves
conversions by giving the best user experience possible and allows you to earn the
international affiliate commissions that you deserve.


= How is GeoRiot different? =

Most link "localization" plugins only translate a link for an international click when the same product ID exists in both storefronts.  The team at GeoRiot has found, however, that oftentimes the same item in different storefronts has a completely different product ID.  In addition, even if the ID does match, the product may be an overpriced "import" item or may never be in stock.  To address this, GeoRiot matches on more than just the product ID to ensure every click gets to the best possible destination.

The Amazon Link Engine plugin uses GeoRiot’s [patented](https://www.google.com/patents/US8838767) five-step algorithm to dig deep into Amazon’s stores to find the best possible result.  This algorithm uses the metadata available from each product to match across storefronts and ensure that the user is sent to the most relevant product. So instead of sending your users to blank search results, we guarantee the best possible user experience.

In addition, connecting your GeoRiot account to the Amazon Link Engine, gives you access to comprehensive reporting on clicks and commissions that no other plugin can offer. These reports allow you to review your link’s performance across many metrics including product type, referrer, browser, device, operating system, destination storefront, and geography.

= How does the Amazon Link Engine plugin work? =

As soon as the plugin is installed, your Amazon links are instantly localized every time a user loads the page.  Even if you add new links to your WordPress site, each will be automatically converted without any additional work from you. Nothing else is needed on your part.

= How do I earn commissions from my links? =

To earn affiliate commissions, you first need to [create a free GeoRiot account](http://www.georiot.com/wordpress-plugin/sign-up), and connect it to your plugin (detailed instructions can be found in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-link-engine/faq/)).  Next, add and manage your affiliate tracking parameters for each of the Amazon Associates programs you’ve signed up for within the GeoRiot Dashboard. Once your parameters are added, the Amazon Link Engine will automatically add the correct affiliate ID per country for each click.

*Note:* You don’t need to create a GeoRiot account, nor add your affiliate parameters to use this plugin. If you’re only interested in giving your international readers a better experience, this plugin can still be used to make sure each click gets redirected to their local storefront.

= Key Features: =
* Automatic localization and translation of all Amazon product links based off a visitor’s location.
* Maximize revenue by earning commissions from all of the Amazon Associates programs.
* Simple, easy to use interface.
* One time configuration. Simply install the plugin, set up your GeoRiot account, and connect the two with an API key.  We take care of the rest.
* No need to sign up for an Amazon Developer account or apply for any of Amazon’s APIs or web tools.
* Your workflow remains the same.  No need to learn a new linking syntax, or disrupt your current flow.

= What makes the Amazon Link Engine different from other Affiliate WP plugins? =
* Most plugins for Amazon links simply try to match based on ASIN (product ID) across foreign storefronts. The Amazon Link Engine uses a patented algorithm to get your users to the best possible destination.
* This in turn helps to both increase conversions and commissions, as well improve the user experience for your audience.
* Completely free support from the GeoRiot team for the Associate’s Programs.
* No need to build links manually with a special link format.  All of your links are automatically converted to localized links when the page loads.
* Always free.  You never need to give us a credit card or send payment.
GeoRiot only makes money when we help you earn more money.

At GeoRiot, clicks are our currency, and we earn money the way you do – through international affiliate programs.

= Do I need to update the JavaScript myself? =
No, the A.L.E. plugin is instantly pulled from a remote server each time your page loads, which means that the snippet is always up to date.  If we update the code from our end, it will instantly be updated on your website upon page load.


= How do I earn International Commissions? =

First, connect the plugin to your GeoRiot account (see "How do I get my API keys?"). Then, follow the steps below:

1. Add your Amazon Affiliate parameters to your GeoRiot dashboard. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](http://support.georiot.com/support/solutions/articles/71867-add-existing-affiliate).
*Note:* If you’ve already done this within your existing GeoRiot account, you do not need to add your parameters again.

1. You’re all set! You’ll start earning international commissions from anything purchased in Amazon’s international storefronts.


= Is the Amazon Link Engine compatible with other affiliate tools? =

* **Skimlinks:**
The Amazon Link Engine plugin works perfectly with Skimlinks.

* **VigLink:**
The VigLink plugin, however, will overwrite the ALE and not allow your links to be globalized if it has already been installed. If you are currently using this plugin, you simply need to deactivate it from your Wordpress site, download and activate the Amazon Link Engine plugin, and then reactivate the Viglink plugin.  Once this is done, the plugins will work seamlessly together.

* **Amazon Publisher Studio:**
The Amazon Publisher Studio tool is unfortunately not compatible with this version of the ALE plugin.


== Screenshots ==

1. **Amazon Link Engine Interface.**
1. **Before:** You have links to an item within a single Amazon storefront. 
1. **After:** When you install the Amazon Link Engine, we automatically globalize and affiliate all links on your WordPress site. 
1. **The workflow:** Nothing changes for you once the plugin is installed. You can still add Amazon links for every page, just as you’ve done before. 
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from the United Kingdom clicking your link. They’re sent to [amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk) with your proper UK Associates ID attached. 
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from the United States clicking your link. They’re sent to [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) with your US Associates ID attached.
